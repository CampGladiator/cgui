## FlashMessage

The flash message is a full-width banner that typically sits at the top of a view or interface area. It is helpful for displaying important information to the user that might need their attention. Flash messages are more disruptive than growl messages but less so than a modal overlay. The badge on the left side of the banner can be used to show a number of notifications that apply, for example, if there are multiple messages that require the userâ€™s attention - without needing to show multiple messages for each notification.
